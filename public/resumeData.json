    "bio":"Hi, Iâ€™ve been a web developer since 2014. For the last 7 years, I specialized in front-end and single page application development. Last 3 years I work mostly in React projects. I have a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS). I worked with a lot of libs as redux-form, redux-saga, redux-query, autoprefixer, etc. I love clean and maintainable code so always use ESlint and sass-lint. Strong Linux(shell) skills, experience with AWS, Apache, Azure and payment integration (Stripe and PayPal) and many backend APIs.",
